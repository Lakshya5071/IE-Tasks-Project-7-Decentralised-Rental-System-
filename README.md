# 🚀 Web3 & AI Project Tasks — Choose Your Task Wisely

This mainly consists of **6 tasks**, each designed to challenge you at different difficulty levels — from **beginner-friendly** Solidity practice to **advanced full-stack AI + blockchain integrations**.

Your mission is to **select one task** that best matches your current skill level, complete it thoroughly, and submit it as a **public GitHub repository**.  
> 💡 Remember: One complete, polished submission is always better than multiple half-finished attempts.

## 🧭 Choosing the Right Task Level

Each task has been crafted for a specific experience tier.  
Use the guide below to pick your ideal project:

### 🟢 Beginner Level — Solidity & Web Fundamentals

**Recommended for:**  
- Students with **no prior experience** in web development or Solidity.

**Focus:**  
- For Solidity beginners: Core smart contract logic, Solidity syntax, events, mappings, and basic blockchain interaction using **Remix IDE**.  
- For Web beginners: Basic frontend development skills, component rendering, state handling, and simple interactivity using **React/Tailwind CSS**.

**Goal:**  
- Solidity learners: Understand how decentralized applications work at the **contract layer**, without worrying about frontend or deployment tools.  
- Web learners: Learn how to **build interactive UI components, handle user inputs, and display dynamic content**, preparing for future integration with blockchain.


### 🟡 Intermediate Level — Web + Blockchain Integration
**Recommended for:**  
- Developers who have a **basic idea of web development** and are interested in exploring **how frontends connect with smart contracts**.

**Focus:**  
- Hands-on experience with **Hardhat, MetaMask, and IPFS**, while building meaningful decentralized applications.

**Goal:**  
- Bridge the gap between **Solidity and Web3 UI**, understanding contract deployment, data retrieval, and interaction flows.

### 🔴 Advanced Level — Full-Stack Web3 + AI Systems
**Recommended for:**  
- Students who are comfortable with **both Web and Blockchain**, and want to explore **AI-powered DApps** or complex full-stack systems.

**Focus:**  
- End-to-end systems combining **AI models, decentralized storage, and blockchain smart contracts**.  
- These projects demand **good problem-solving**, API handling, and UI/UX design.

**Goal:**  
- Showcase your ability to build a **production-level Web3 + AI application**.


## ✅ Submission Guidelines

1. Choose **only one task** based on your skill level. If you have enough time you can also attempt other tasks as well.
   Completing one full project demonstrates better understanding than starting multiple.

2. Ensure your **GitHub repository is public**.  
   - Include clear commit history.  
   - Add a detailed `README.md` explaining setup, functionality, and technologies used.

3. **Submit your completed project here:**  
[**Google Form Link**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfi-VRmObHL9TBfbqnmlPW57AhyQo7ObyNGe20FjXmWPTz1hw/viewform?usp=header)

## 🧩 Final Advice

- Read the task description thoroughly before starting.  
- Plan your approach — architecture, data flow, and component structure.  
- Prioritize **completeness and clarity** over adding unnecessary features.
